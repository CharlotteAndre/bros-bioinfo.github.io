## Software and Plant Recognition
### Domitille 
Pant identification is a very important tool for ecosystem studies. 
#### Why identify a plant ?
- Curiosity about plant characteristics
- Scientific and Ecosystems studies

Exemple :  
- *Lychis flos-cuculi* + *Cirsium palustre* ==> Alluvial meadow

#### Key characteristics:
- Plant structure:
- Flower structure

Q : Any kind of indexes or definitions in the flora ? (ex. Collins Flower Guides)  
Hard to navigate through key of identification -> needs of software

#### Pl@nt.net

- Species prediction:
  - Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)  
- Similarity search
  - Hashing based approximate Nearest Neighbors algorithm
  
#### Conclusion
- Access to everyone
- Easier and faster to study

## The Earth BioGenome Project
### Marina
#### Aim
Sequencing DNA of all Earth's Eukaryotes.  
One of the most ambitious project in biology *(Why do you say that ?!)*.
#### Methodology of Sequencing
First times:
- Chemical properties of nucleotides
- Sanger's method (Human genome project)
Nowadays:
- Nanopore sequencing
- NGS
#### The project itself
Why sequencing Eukaryotes' DNA:
- Better understanding of biology and evolution
  - Understand the evolutionary relationships 
  - Discover new species
  - Elucidate evolution
- Enable the conservation, protection and regeneration of biodiversity
- Maximize returns to society and human welfare
  - Discovery of new ways of dealing with problem inspired by nature
  
#### Organization of EBP
- Sequence at least 1 specie per genus so that they can classify in a good tree of life
  - 5000 arthropodes genome to sequence for exemple
- Work with all other DNA sequencing project
- 4.7 billion dollars

## Races & Biology (Social Ethics)
### Antoine
#### History of "Race"
- 1839 : Samuel George Morton : Crania Americana
- 1950 : UNESCO : The race question
- 2000 : Craig Venter, Achievment of the Human Genome Project

ssp != race because evolution applies in the second one and not the first
Human do not apply the
#### Is this word necessary
Ethnicity > Race .  
But ethnicity can be useful for medecine. 
#### Then how to classify differences ?
- Ethnicity = cultural
- Origins = geographical
- Populations = Neutral

## Using metabarcoding for environmental studies
### Claire
#### What is metaboardcoding
- Sampling iin the field
- Extracting DNA
- Gene selection
  - Gene common to the whole group you study (Animals / Plant / etc.)
    - CO1 for ANimals
- Sequencing
- Data cleaning:
  - Retrieving small sequences
  - Aligning contigs
- compare with a database
#### Advantages
- Fast
- Less expensive

#### Limitations
- Sensitive to degragation of DNA 
- Abundance data is limited (How many is there ?)

## Evolution of Behaviors
### Charlotte
#### Behaviors:
- Mutually beneficial
- Egoistic
- Altruistic
- Spiteful
#### Why species evolve to acquire one of those behaviors?
To determine the **behavior** according to traits, you **genetics** are complementary of **social study**.

## Gut Microbiome study techniques 
### Elsa
#### Old method : Linear model
#### New technique : Phylogenetic linear modellling
- Draw the tree
- Include the prevalence of microbes
- Presence or abscence of genes in the clades

### Mirna Marie-Joseph
- CNN

## Genomics and Genomic editing in treatment
